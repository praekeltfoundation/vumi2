Applications
============

Applications are the reason messaging systems exist in the first place. They receive
inbound messages and send outbound messages, presumably to provide some useful service.
As such, their behaviour depends very much on the nature of the service they provide.

Applications can also provide integration with external systems, essentially serving as
transports in reverse.

The following applications are available:
